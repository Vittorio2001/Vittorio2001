## Hello everyone 👋

My name is Vittorio, and I am from Italy. I am currently a Computer Engineering student at @[Unina](https://www.unina.it/home;jsessionid=713EDAFF2C4FF71107586896FA049017.node_publisher12). I am passionate about technology and innovation, but also I am a video game and bodybuilder enthusiast. My goal is to learn every aspect of programming and ultimately work for a big tech company!
